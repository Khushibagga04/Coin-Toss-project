# Coin-Toss-project
A simple project that simulates tossing a coin. The program randomly outputs “Heads” or “Tails” each time you run it, mimicking a real coin flip. This is useful for learning basic programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional logic, and user interaction.

Features:
-Simulates a fair coin toss
-User-friendly interface (command line or GUI, as per your implementation)
-Keeps track of the number of tosses and results (optional extension)
-Great for beginners to practice coding and understand probability

Concepts Used:
-Random Number Generation
-Conditional Statements
-Variables
-Loops (optional)
-Input/Output (I/O)
-Functions (optional)
-Basic Probability

How to Run:
-Open "Cointossgame.c" in Turbo C++
-Press 'Ctrl+F9' to compile and run
